-- B. Data Analysis Questions
-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as customer_count
FROM subscriptions;


-- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
WITH TRIALS AS
    (SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month',start_date) as month,
    COUNT(customer_id) as trial_starts
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_id = 0
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month',start_date)
    ORDER BY month)
SELECT * FROM TRIALS;

--subquery
SELECT 
(SELECT MAX(start_date) FROM subscriptions) as max_start, 
* FROM (SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month',start_date) as month,
    COUNT(customer_id) as trial_starts
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_id = 0
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month',start_date)
    ORDER BY month) as S;

-- 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

WITH CTE AS(
select * from subscriptions as s 
inner join plans as p 
on s.plan_id = p.plan_id
where year(start_date) >2020)
SELECT  plan_name, count(customer_id) as events FROM CTE
GROUP BY plan_name;


-- 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

SELECT 
(SELECT count( distinct customer_id) FROM subscriptions) as total_custs, 
*, (churn/total_custs)*100 as percent_churn 
FROM ( 
select count(distinct customer_id) as churn from subscriptions as s 
inner join plans as p 
on s.plan_id = p.plan_id
where plan_name = 'churn') as p;

-- 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

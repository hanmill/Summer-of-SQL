/*
IBAN Code Order:
- Country Code
- Check Digits
- Bank Code
- Sort Code
- Account Number

REQUIREMENTS

- In the Transactions table, there is a Sort Code field which contains dashes. We need to remove these so just have a 6 digit string
- Use the SWIFT Bank Code lookup table to bring in additional information about the SWIFT code and Check Digits of the receiving bank account
- Add a field for the Country Code
  Hint: all these transactions take place in the UK so the Country Code should be GB
- Create the IBAN as above
  Hint: watch out for trying to combine sting fields with numeric fields - check data types
- Remove unnecessary fields

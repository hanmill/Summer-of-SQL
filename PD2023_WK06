--Input the data
--Reshape the data so we have 5 rows for each customer, with responses for the Mobile App and Online Interface being in separate fields on the same row
--Clean the question categories so they don't have the platform in from of them
----e.g. Mobile App - Ease of Use should be simply Ease of Use
--Exclude the Overall Ratings, these were incorrectly calculated by the system
--Calculate the Average Ratings for each platform for each customer 
--Calculate the difference in Average Rating between Mobile App and Online Interface for each customer
--Catergorise customers as being:
--Mobile App Superfans if the difference is greater than or equal to 2 in the Mobile App's favour
--Mobile App Fans if difference >= 1
--Online Interface Fan
--Online Interface Superfan
--Neutral if difference is between 0 and 1
--Calculate the Percent of Total customers in each category, rounded to 1 decimal place
--Output the data

I got different figures at the end due to the fact that I didn't re-pivot my data for point 6 and used iff statements to extract the data and then aggregate - I think this is where the differing figures arrose from.
swapping out the fir iff statements within my MOBILE_ONLINE CTE for a pivot fixed my finalised figures

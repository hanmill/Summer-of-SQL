A. CUSTOMER NODES EXPLORATION

1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
  SELECT count(distinct(node_id)) from customer_nodes
    A. 5
  
2. What is the number of nodes per region?
  SELECT count(distinct(node_id)), region_name from customer_nodes as C
  inner join regions as R 
    on C.region_id = R.region_id
  group by region_name

  select  r.region_name, count(distinct(node_id)) as number_of_nodes from customer_nodes as c
  inner join regions as r 
  on c.region_id = r.region_id
  group by  r.region_name
  
3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
  SELECT count(distinct(customer_id)) as no_of_cust, region_name from customer_nodes as C
  inner join regions as R 
    on C.region_id = R.region_id
  group by region_name

  select region_name, count(distinct customer_id) as number_of_customers from customer_nodes as c
  inner join regions as r
  on c.region_id = r.region_id
  group by region_name
  order by region_name

4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
  with CTE AS(
  select customer_id, node_id, sum(datediff('day', start_date, end_date)) as days_in_node from customer_nodes
  where end_date != '9999-12-31'
  group by customer_id, node_id
  )
  select round(avg(days_in_node),0) as avg_days_in_node from CTE

5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?



B. CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS

1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transcation type?
  select txn_type, count(customer_id) as unique_count, sum(txn_amount) as total_amount from customer_transactions
  group by txn_type

2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
  WITH CTE AS(
  select customer_id, sum(txn_amount) as total, count(*) as count from customer_transactions
  where txn_type = 'deposit'
  group by customer_id
  )
  SELECT round(avg(total),2) as average_amount, round(avg(count),2) as average_count from CTE

3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
  WITH CTE AS (
  select 
  customer_id, 
  date_trunc('month', txn_date) as month,  
  sum(iff(txn_type='deposit',1,0)) as no_of_deposits,
  sum(iff(txn_type<>'deposit',1,0)) as no_of_purchases_and_withdrawals
  from customer_transactions
  group by customer_id, date_trunc('month', txn_date)
  having no_of_deposits >1 AND no_of_purchases_and_withdrawals =1
  )
  SELECT month, count(customer_id) as customers FROM CTE 
  group by month;

4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?
  WITH CTE AS (
  select * , (case when txn_type <> 'deposit' then -txn_amount else txn_amount end) as balance from customer_transactions
  )
  SELECT customer_id, date_trunc('month', txn_date) as month, sum(balance) as closing_balance from CTE 
  group by customer_id, date_trunc('month', txn_date)
  having customer_id = '109';

--Input the data
--For the Transaction Path table:
--Make sure field naming convention matches the other tables
-----i.e. instead of Account_From it should be Account From
--For the Account Information table:
--Make sure there are no null values in the Account Holder ID
--Ensure there is one row per Account Holder ID
--Joint accounts will have 2 Account Holders, we want a row for each of them
--For the Account Holders table:
--Make sure the phone numbers start with 07
--Bring the tables together
--Filter out cancelled transactions 
--Filter to transactions greater than Â£1,000 in value 
--Filter out Platinum accounts
--Output the data

I found this challenge quite managable, learning lateral split to table.

WITH ACC_INFO AS (
    SELECT value as account_holder_id, account_number, account_type, balance_date, balance
    FROM pd2023_wk07_account_information, LATERAL SPLIT_TO_TABLE(account_holder_id,', ')
    WHERE account_holder_id IS NOT NULL
)
,

    account_holder_id,
    name,
    date_of_birth,
